## Why FastApi

FastAPI has impressive speed, simple API, and built-in documentation. 
And I've already worked with this.

## Best practices:
1. Use requirements.txt for list required packages. This makes it easier to get started with the application.
2. "Keep it simple". Very simple and short code.
3. Use very simple and fast ASGI - Uvicorn

## Unit test best practices:
1. Use a library for testing
2. Use simple tests
3. Craft deterministic tests
